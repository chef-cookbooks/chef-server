- Improve testing with spec cleanups and using dokken-images in Travis CI

## 5.4.0 (2017-04-12)

## 5.3.0 (2017-04-11)

## 5.2.0 (2017-03-27)

- Pin chef-ingredient and require Chef 12.5+

## 5.1.0 (2016-09-16)
- Testing updates

## v5.0.1 (2016-04-28)

As of Chef management console 2.3.0 the [Chef MLSA must be accepted when reconfiguring the product.](https://docs.chef.io/install_server.html) Chef ingredient added the [accept_license](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-ingredient/pull/101) property to provide a way to automate this. This fix adds the attribute ['chef-server']['accept_license']. The default value is _false_. Individuals must explicitly change the value to true in their environment. 

## v5.0.0 (2016-04-13)

### Breaking Changes:

This cookbook now requires chef-ingredient 0.18 or later. This switches the package source for chef-server packages to packages.chef.io, and also changes the names of the server add-ons as follows:

- chef-ha -> ha
- chef-sync -> sync
- push-server -> push-jobs-server

## v4.1.0 (2015-08-31)

- [#105](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-server): Move `fqdn_resolves` method to chef-ingredient cookbook.

## v4.0.0 (2015-06-30)

**Major version update, breaking changes ahead**

- 84: Add ability to set the package source with an attribute for local package installation
- 90: **Breaking** Use [chef-ingredient cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef-ingredient). The breaking change is that of the configuration file. Users who are modifying the configuration with the `node['chef-server']['configuration']` attribute as a hash will need to convert it to a string. See the README for more detail.
- 93: Add a `topology` attribute. Finally you can use this cookbook for non-standalone installs.

## v3.1.1 (2015-04-09)

- various cleanup
- rubocop -a
- adding .kitchen.cloud.yml
- minor readability refactoring

## v3.1.0 (2015-03-16)

- Add a recipe and attribute to support installing addons. These are Chef premium features, see the README for more information about the `addons` recipe.

## v3.0.1 (2015-03-02)

- Issue #74, use :reconfigure action instead of notification so other configuration can happen after the Server is up within the same Chef run.

## v3.0.0 (2015-02-24)

**Major Version Update**
